LigHTML
=======

HTML is heavy. Send LigHTML instead!

Lightml files  can be generated with a simple PHP script called on top of your pages.

Lightml files are regular HTML files containing

  <!doctype html>
  <script src='lightml.js'></script>

followed by Lightml code.

lightml.js seamlessly converts the Lightml code in HTML.
